Hi we are team capsule our aim /solution is that we have innovated a vehicle which has the potential to be the next technological change in our indian history 
our idea uses vtol ( vertical take of and landing) tech to fly like both helicopter and airplane to replace both air and road ways , also uses thrust vectoring engines if possible to steer
we divide the construction of the prototype into 3 phases
1.framing:manufacturing of frame play a key role a of the entire vehicle and it works as a backbone of thevehicle making it durableand strong while being  lightweight so we choosen carbon fibre or polycarbonate steel 
2.hardware:hardware plays the role of mechanicall function of a pod , most ofthe flights equipment such astransponder communications,altimeter for height spedometer sensors to detect other airplanes near by,flightpath calculators hydraulics for actuators,fly by wire system,thrust vectoring 4 part electric engine, solid state battery which will be placed either on front of back or around the frame after every other hardware is done
3.finishing:painting and plating of either aluminium or any other plastic components to give it a smooth outside finish with all the electricals connected seats put in and other work is done
components we use in these protype for emergency back up power, flight computational pc
they have military grade resistance towards malware attacks using the best firewalls and steel casings to place this computer
these also send their information to other vehicles sharing related flight information ,they also share their flight information to a centralised atc and real monitoring system 
it has a error management system with the final case scenario as using a parachute and inflatable devices 
in all it is autonomous and revolutionary 


let me ask u guys a question what is road infrastructure? travelling to one place to another ? we have a culture around travelling and around vehicles road infrastructure connects us to every part of the nationo are something are conncecting us in a way , but these also have a lot of problems creating new roads means more money man power maintaince environment pollution etc etc 
creating or destroying one roadway is a big task needing crores of investment to create something connecting two places faster and better we have no alternative than road infrastructure as logistics also relies on this one main backbone 
costs aren't the only thing accidents , environment and slow speeds are a problem too	
if roads aren't maintained or properly constructed there is again a slower speed making it difficult to travel accidents are a major problem this solves compared to a regular guy who has a chance of hitting someone or something everyday is 1:5 , countless human accidents and animal accidents happen due to our human error , imposing more fines or new rules to curb this fails everytime as someone keeps passing away due to the imperfections of 3 factors 
vehcile design,human error,road maintenence
the solution is quite simple create infrastructure which can tackle all of these and the solution here we offer is similar this electric pod designed to carry from 1-30 people depending upon the quantity its fuel source is electricity which is now been harnessed by solar and wind energy,it reduces environment pollution saves energy and also reduces maintaience cost.
this vehcile offers safety in no way offered by anyone design to keep you and the surroundings safe
cost to produce one is similar to that of car starting at 5 or 6 lakhs.
monitoring services helps keep this safe at all costs 
logistics can also be transferred the way it used  to but it now travels through air rather than road increasing logistics, time and profits.

the link below is our reference model although the perfected one will be uploaded soon in this link
